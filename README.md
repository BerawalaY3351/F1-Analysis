# F1-Analysis (Seasonal Project)

## 2024 Season Analysis

### Project Overview
This project aims to design and implement a data engineering and analysis solution for Formula One racing data to provide insights and predictions. The focus is on optimizing car and driver performance by analyzing various data points including telemetry, car and driver performance, race tracks, weather, and more.

### Data Sources
- **Telemetry Data**: Collected using the FastF1 API, which provides in-depth car and driver performance metrics.
- **Car and Driver Performance Data**: Historical data on driver lap times, speeds, and sector times.
- **Race Track Data**: Detailed characteristics and layouts of various circuits.
- **Weather Data**: Weather conditions impacting race performance.

### Data Processing
The data processing workflow includes:
- **Ingestion**: Data is collected from multiple sources, primarily via APIs.
- **Cleaning and Transformation**: Using Python scripts in Jupyter Notebooks, the data is cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis.

### Data Analysis
The analysis involves exploring the data, identifying patterns and trends, and applying machine learning models to optimize car and driver performance. Key aspects include:
- **Python and Jupyter Notebook**: For data manipulation, visualization, and analysis workflows.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Used to predict performance outcomes, compare driving styles, and analyze key factors affecting race results.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Core language for all data processing and analysis tasks.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data exploration, analysis, and visualization.
- **Machine Learning**: Models are used for performance prediction and to uncover deeper insights from the data.

### Limitations
- **Aerodynamics Analysis**: The project does not cover aerodynamic analysis due to the lack of necessary data and the complexity of simulations.
- **Regulation Changes**: The project considers major regulation changes in 2022 and 2023, which significantly impact car design and race strategy.

### Machine Learning Integration
The project leverages the FastF1 API data, integrated with machine learning techniques to compare driving styles, predict driver performance, and optimize strategies. Specific use cases include comparing the driving styles of Daniel Ricciardo and Lando Norris using telemetry data.
